Most suicide attempters are between 30-49. This is age when people are adult and may have bad life experience.
In the graph, we can see that every year number of suicides is rising regardless of age.
Also we can see that the biggest increse is visible in age 13-18 (teenagers).

Let's focus on the youngest people. Amount of children to 12 years old attempting suicide is the fastest growing, it has growed almost 4 times during just 5 years. 
There is many causes why they can do that. For example family problems, problems at school, mental illnesses, hhysical illnesses or disabilities.

The most common method of suicide in Poland is suicide by hanging. Mainly because it is the most accessible and effective.

The most effective method is shooting but it's not so accessible as hanging.
